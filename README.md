## :innocent: Motivation
It is very difficult for an individual to find a bank in a new city to which he/she is completely stranger.
Many people from villages come to cities for investing or creating a bank account in order to save their earnings.The people who are not much aware of technology might find it difficult to use fancy Apps. In order to build a bridge between a city and a person who is unknown to the city ,there must be some system which must act as a guide.
So, we came up with an idea in which we ask the person the nearby famous landmark in the city. The system is designed in such a way that it will take user input and display the information about bank ,this information include Bank name,address,Weekly timetable of Bank(in hrs) ,Phone number of branch also detail about availability of ATM machine and Deposit machine.In this way a our proposed system can be helpful to people. 

</br></br> This is a terminal Based application that is made using client server architecture.




<!---Unable to communicate verbally is a disability. In order to communicate there are many ways, one of the most popular methods is the use of predefined sign languages. The purpose of this project is to bridge the __research gap__ and to contribute to recognize __American sign languages(ASL)__ with maximum efficiency. This repository focuses on the recognition of ASL in real time, converting predicted characters to sentences and output is generated in terms of voice formats. The system is trained by convolutional neural networks for the classification of __26 alphabets__ and one extra alphabet for null character. The proposed work has achieved an efficiency of __99.88%__ on the test set.--->

## :star: Algorithm

STEP 1:START<br>
STEP 2: Establish secure connection between client sever(Enter proper ip address)<br>
STEP 3:Fix errors(if any) while establishing connection.<br>
STEP 4:After establishing connection ask (user)client side to enter the choice.<br>
STEP 5: On client side, check if the choice is valid or not.<br>
If( not valid)<br>
 ask user to enter a valid choice<br>
Else<br>
  Send choice to server
STEP 6:Server Side Recieve the choice sent by client<br>
STEP 7:Load the contents of file associated with the choice into buffer and send it to client side.<br>
STEP 8:The result is displayed on the client side to the user (as soon as buffer arrives on the client side)<br>
STEP 9:END<br>
